# BigMood
Project for UofA CMPUT301

This is an app where you can track your own mood, and follow a friends profile to get updates on their mood. This is a social app targeting users of all ages for expressing their moods to close friends, family and people around them. We all know mental health has always been an important issue for the current generation, as people find difficulty expressing their thoughts and emotion where social media influence their thoughts dramatically.


*To run the project without the SDK, the SHA-1 key needs to be added to the firebase console.
